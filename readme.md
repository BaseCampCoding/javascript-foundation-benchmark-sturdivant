# JavaScript Foundation - Benchmark: Travel Booking System 

**You will create a simple "Travel Booking System" that allows users to manage and view bookings for different types of travel (such as flights, trains, or buses). Youâ€™ll define classes, create objects, use arrays, and write functions to work with your data.**

## Task
### 1. Define a `Booking` Class
- Create a class named `Booking`.
- The class should have the following properties:
  - `travelerName`
  - `destination`
  - `date`
  - `type` (for example: flight, train, bus)
- Add a method called `describe()` that returns a string describing the booking.
  - `travelerName` booked a `type` to `destination` on `date`.

### 2. Create a Subclass called `FlightBooking`
- Create at least one subclass of `Booking` (for example: `FlightBooking`).
- The subclass should hold an additional property:
  - Add property property `flightNumber`
  - Override the `describe()` method to include the additional property in the description.
    -  `travelerName` booked a flight to `destination` on `date` (Flight Number: `flightNumber`).

### 3. Manage a List of Bookings
- Create an array called `bookings` to hold booking objects.
  - Add at least three bookings to the array (make sure the bookings are of more than one type).

### 4. Add Booking Information
- Create a function called `addBooking`
  - This function should take in a booking object and add it to the array.

### 5. Add Booking Information
- Create a function called `removeBooking`
  - This function should take in a booking object and remove it from the array.

### 6. Display Booking Information
- Create a function called `displayBooking`
  - This function should use a loop to display the description of each booking in the array by calling their `describe()` method.

### 7. Find Bookings by Type
- Create a function called `bookingType` that takes a type (e.g., `"flight"`) and an array as an argument and returns all bookings of that type from your array.


## Example
If you have the following data in your array
The output of your program should look something like this if I call displayBooking:

```
All bookings:
Alice Smith booked a flight to Paris on 2025-10-15 (Flight Number: AF123).
Bob Jones booked a train to Berlin on 2025-11-01.
Cara Lee booked a flight to Tokyo on 2025-12-05 (Flight Number: JL456).
```

The output of your program should look something like this if I call typeBooking:
```
All flight bookings:
Alice Smith booked a flight to Paris on 2025-10-15 (Flight Number: AF123).
Cara Lee booked a flight to Tokyo on 2025-12-05 (Flight Number: JL456).
```
